Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? What do you need to do it?

A: Basically a .git file gets added. The steps to do it are as follows:

1. cd to the relevant directory e.g. $ cd ~/version-control/reflections
2. Then enter $ git init -- this initializes the directory
3. The enter $ git status -- to check that all is well and the directory is initialized



Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the respoitory? 
What value do you think it offers?

A: The staging area is a temporary area that lets the developer make decisions 
about files prior to committing them. It exists between the "hard" areas of the working directory and the 
repository and allows some flexibility prior to making decisions.
